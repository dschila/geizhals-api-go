# Geizhals API Go
Using geizhals.de via a RESTFul interface to search and display products. 

## Motivation
As part of a private project to learn the programming language Go, I needed the possibility to collect availability of articles from Geizhals.de without calling the website directly. 

## Contribute
Maybe someone will find the project helpful or can give me hints/improvements.
